# Operating Systems - Exercise 2
## Task 5
**Concurrency:**
Concurrency has the target to create the illusion that multiple tasks are processed simultaniously.
This is achieved by interleaving the processing of the multiple tasks at a high enough frequency to seem synchronous.
The processing time of the cpu is split over all the tasks.

**Parallelism:**
Parallelism devides tasks into smaller parts.
Those parts are then devided into multiple CPUs and therefore run simultaneously.
